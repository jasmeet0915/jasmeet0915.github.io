If you are like me, you want RGB lights in everything. Be it your mouse, your keyboard, or heck even your room. Therefore, to fulfill this colorful need, I started working on a project to install the addressable WS2812B LEDs to the shelves in my room. The plan was simple: use an ESP8266-based board (specifically the Wemos D1 Mini) with WLED installed as the main controller, hook it up the LEDs and use the WLED Android App to control the LEDs.\nA sneak peek of the finished project If you are interested in making the project yourself, you can go through and follow the steps in my Instructable.\nSo as with any project, I hopped on the Delhi metro, arrived at the local market and bought all the required stuff including the LED Strip, Wemos D1 Mini board, an IRF540N n-channel MOSFET, some JST Connectors and screw terminals etc.\nAnyways, back to the story. So, after getting all the stuff I returned home, connected the Wemos D1 Mini to my laptop, selected the correct port in Arduino IDE and uploaded the blink LED sketch to test the board. Aaaaand it didn\u0026rsquo;t work ü•≤\nUpon close inspection, I found some weird stuff going on with the board!! And with that came a realization\u0026hellip;\nNever Blindly Trust the Stuff You Buy # So here\u0026rsquo;s the problem: Whenever the board is connected, a serial port shows up in the Arduino IDE but no matter what, you cannot upload any code to it. Even dmesg shows that it is loading a driver for the FT232RL USB-to-UART Chip!\ndmesg output when the Wemos D1 Mini board was connected. It shows that the Kernel is loading the drivers for the FT232RL USB-to-UART Even the windows device manager does the same: assigns FT232 drivers for the device but the result is still the same. We can see the idVendor in the dmesg output as 0403 and a quick google search shows that this Vendor ID indeed belongs to FTDI (this is the company that manufactures the FT232RL chip). But here\u0026rsquo;s the catch:\nIf you read the Official Wemos Documentation for the D1 mini, it shows that the board uses CH340 as the USB-to-UART Converter not the FT232R! üòµ‚Äçüí´\nSooooo, what the hell is happening here?\nTo find some answers I turned to the board specifically to see if it was actually using the FT232. And guess what? The name of the IC is erased off\u0026hellip;ü•≤ Believe me when I say this does not end here. It gets better.\nThe Wemos D1 Mini board backside that shows the USB-to-UART chip with no name I opened up the pinout of FT232R and the CH340 side by side, powered the board and started probing some pins with my multimeter to see which pinout it matches. Aaanddd\u0026hellip;drum rolls please\u0026hellip;it matches the pinout of the CH340 IC!! So, it is indeed CH340 but it acts like FT232R causing the OS to load the wrong drivers and resulting in the board not working.\nSo people, that\u0026rsquo;s why you should never completely trust the stuff you buy locally. As for me, I kept the board aside for further investigations and turned to next closest thing to an ESP-based board I had at the ready. This turned out to be the Bolt IOT Wifi Module which I had bought about 3 years back but never used once.\nThe Bolt IOT wifi module If I had this, then why didn\u0026rsquo;t I go with it in the first place? Well, because although the WEMOS D1 Mini and Bolt IOT wifi module both use the same ESP-12E at its core, there is a big difference. While the Wemos D1 Mini is a developement board and can be programmed through USB for any application, the Bolt IOT Wifi Module is, in fact, a module. It comes pre-flashed with some code that allows you to program it through the Bolt IOT cloud platform (or app) or you can hook it up to an Arduino as a wifi module. The module itself does not have any USB-to-UART Converter on board. In my opinion, this feels like of a waste of capability of the ESP-12E module as it prevents standalone use of the board which I wanted in my case. So, let\u0026rsquo;s see how I worked my way around this.\nThe ESP-12E Bootloader Modes \u0026amp; How it gets Programmed # To understand how I used the Bolt IOT Wifi Module for this, we first need to understand the bootloader modes of the ESP-12E module. When we power up the ESP-12E module, there are 3 different modes the moduel can enter:\nNormal Mode UART Programming Mode SD-Card Boot Here we only care about the Normal Mode and the UART Programming Mode. Normal Mode or the Flash Start-up Mode, as the name suggests, loads the program saved in the module\u0026rsquo;s internal flash and starts executing it. This is mode we are most familiar with. The UART Programming Mode is the one which allows you to upload a new program to the module\u0026rsquo;s flash memory through UART. The bootloader which gets selected when the device powers up or is reset, depends on the state of some of the GPIOs. Below you can find a table that shows the required GPIO states for different bootloader modes.\nBootloader Mode GPIO 0 GPIO 2 GPIO 15 Normal Mode 1 1 0 UART Programming Mode 0 1 0 SD Card Boot 0 0 1 From the table above, we can easily infer that the state of GPIO 0 is the main deciding factor for our desired bootloader modes as the other two GPIOs have the same state in both cases. Apart from this, if the RESET pin gets connected to GND, the board resets and again selects the bootloader mode accroding to the states of the above GPIOs. Below you can find a pinout diagram of ESP-12E for reference.\nESP-12E module pinout. Credits: Random Nerd Tutorials So basically this is what we need to do to make the ESP-12E on the Bolt IOT Module Programmable:\nPull GPIO 2 up Pull GPIO 15 down Have some sort of mechanism to change the state of GPIO 0 as required Have a push button connected to the RESET pin that connects it GND when pressed Upon inspecting the ESP12-E on the Bolt IOT Module these are the things I found:\nRESET Pin was left floating GPIO2 was left floating GPIO15 was connected to the GND Plane GPIO0 was left floating. Since the board already had a program flashed for OTA (over the air) uploads they don\u0026rsquo;t need the GPIO0 Making the ESP-12E on the Bolt IOT Module Programmable # So from the above points I knew I had to only:\nConnect GPIO2 to VCC through a pull up resistor Connect a push button to RESET that connects it to GND when pressed. We can name this the \u0026lsquo;Reset\u0026rsquo; button. Connect a GPIO0 to a push button that connects it to GND when pressed. We can name this the \u0026lsquo;Boot\u0026rsquo; button. Have a 6 Pin female header that exposes the TX, RX and GND pins for connecting an external USB-to-UART Converter Module to program the module Here\u0026rsquo;s a schematic of how this was done:\nA schematic of the setup I made. It does not show the connections of the Bolt IOT module like the voltage regulator, on-board LEDs, etc. Once this is done, to program the mode we can simply press the Boot button and then reset the board using the Reset button. This will send the board in the Programming Mode and then we can hook up the external USB-to-UART module and upload a program to the board!\nNote: You might have seen the same two buttons (Reset and Boot) on some ESP-based boards like the NodeMCU or ESP32. These work on the same principle.\nNote: You also might have noticed that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do play with these buttons everytime on a board like the NodeMCU. Heck the Arduino UNO does not even have a Boot button. So, how are they changing the bootloader modes? This is where the USB-to-UART IC comes in. It automatically sends some signals to the required pins and changes the bootloader modes when you press the upload button on your Arduino IDE.\nHere are some photos of the final soldered setup on a perf board for the final project:\nThe Bolt IOT wifi module with the wires soldered on required GPIOs Above schematic soldered on a perf board And here are some images of the final project: ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/programming-non-programmable-esp/","section":"Blogs","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  See how I repurposed the ESP module from a more or less useless and limited commercial board for my own project.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are like me, you want RGB lights in everything.

Being a strong believer of project-based learning, I decided to make a project using the timer instead of just cramming up the theory. Fast forwarding a couple weeks, here I present to you 555 Timer based Servo Tester üéâ\n555 Timer Servo Tester in action. Here I am controlling the base joint servo of a robotic arm \u0026amp; drive servo for a linear actuator mechanism on one of my mobile robots. In this blog, I would like to share some interesting problems I faced and their solutions. But first, let\u0026rsquo;s start with the basics.\nHow Servo Motors Work # A servo motor is a motor which can be moved to a particular angle. Internally, the servo uses a closed loop system to control the position of the shaft. Like any other closed loop system, this system also needs a feedback (position feedback in this case) to control the output. This is achieved with the help of a potentiometer.\nBut how dow you send angles as commands to the servo?\nWell, a servo has 3 wires 2 of which are obviously VCC and GND for powering the internal DC motor. The third wire is where the magic happens. The third wire is the signal wire where you provide a PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) signal to get different angles. The relation between PWM signal and servo angle can be seen in the table below.\nServo Angle (degrees) Signal On Time (ms) Period (ms) Duty Cycle (%) 0 1 20 5 90 1.5 20 7.5 180 2 20 10 Note: The above values are all ideal. In reality, I have even noticed the duty cycle for some servos to range from 2% to 14%!\nSo from this information we can conclude that to move a servo all we need is some power and a PWM signal. So how do we do that? We use the 555 Timer üòé\nNote: We could also use a controller or a development board like arduino for this. Heck they even have in-built libraries so you don\u0026rsquo;t even have to write the code that generates the PWM signal according to the above table. You just pass the angle to the servo.write() function and sit back while the library does its magic. But, where\u0026rsquo;s the fun in that :p\n555 Timer and its Different Modes # The 555 Timer IC is a cheap and precise timing IC that can be used to generate various kinds of clock or PWM signals. The 555 timer can be used in following modes:\nMonostable Mode: In this mode, the output of the 555 timer is driven high for a fixed time when an input trigger is detected. This mode, therefore, contains a single stable output state - hence the name \u0026lsquo;Monostable\u0026rsquo;. Know more about this mode here 555 Timer in Monostable Mode. The output turns ON for about 1.1s when switch is closed \u0026amp; Trig is pulled to GND. While the output is ON it completely ignores the Trig input.The circuit on Multisim can be found here Bistable Mode: In this mode, the output of the 555 timer is driven high when the input trigger is detected and driven low when reset is driven low. This mode, therefore, contains 2 stable output states - hence the name \u0026lsquo;Bistable\u0026rsquo;. Know more about this mode here 555 Timer in Bistable Mode. The circuit uses a SPDT switch to connect either pin TRIG or RESET to GND. This accordingly turn the LED on or off.The circuit on Multisim can be found here Note: After seeing the gif above you might be wondering why go through all that trouble? Just use a switch :| Well, the answer is in \u0026lsquo;Debouncing\u0026rsquo;. See, when we use mechanical switches, the signal passing through them bounces when the contacts touch or separate. This can sometimes be a problem for your circuit as it might give false positives. Since this circuit uses the internal SR-Latch flip flop of the 555 Timer, it ignores the bouncing of the switch and gives us a stable output. This \u0026lsquo;debounced\u0026rsquo; output is really important for timing applications. Do watch the linked videos for more clarity about this.\nAstable Mode: In this mode, the output of the 555 timer generates a square wave without any intervention from the user. The square wave is infact a PWM signal whose duty cycle can be adjusted by changing the values of the timing capacitors and resistors. Know more about this mode here 555 Timer in Astable Mode. The circuit uses a potentiometer to change the pulse width or the duty cycle of the output signal. We can see the LED pulsing in the output.The circuit on Multisim can be found here \u0026lsquo;Stable\u0026rsquo; in all modes above simply means that the output will tend to stay in that state until an input trigger is detected. In \u0026lsquo;Monostable\u0026rsquo; there is a single stable state which is the default state of the output and the output can be taken out of that state with the input trigger. In case of \u0026lsquo;Bistable\u0026rsquo;, both states of the output are considered stable and you can switch between them using 2 different input triggers. The \u0026lsquo;Astable\u0026rsquo; mode however, does not have any stable state and just gives a square wave on the output.\nOperating Servos with 555 timer in Astable Mode # Since the Astable mode of operation provides us with a PWM signal at the output, its pretty obvious that we can use it to operate servos.\nWe can even replace one of the timing resistors with a potentiometer to control the duty cycle of the PWM output and get a full sweep of motion from the controlled servo.\nSimple, right? Well sadly, its not that straight forward :/\nThe Problem with Generic Astable Mode # Let\u0026rsquo;s first have a closer look at the circuit of a 555 Timer in \u0026lsquo;Generic Astable Mode\u0026rsquo;. Why \u0026lsquo;Generic\u0026rsquo;? Because this the circuit you will see most of the times when looking for 555 timer in astable mode.\n555 Timer in Astable Mode Here, the values of the resistors $R3$ \u0026amp; $R4$ and capacitor $C2$ determine the on time and off time of the PWM output. Therefore, we can control the duty cycle of the PWM output if we add a variable resistor in the mix (like done in the above gif). But to make explanations easier lets omit the potentiometer for now. In the circuit above, the on time \u0026amp; off time can be calculated as follows:\n$$ T_{high}=0.693 * (R3 + R4) * C2 $$$$ T_{low}=0.693 * R3 * C2 $$$$ T_{period}=0.693 * (R4 + 2R3) * C2 $$From the above equations we can easily see,\n$$ T_{high} \u003e T_{low}, \\ always $$Since, the duty cycle of a PWM signal is the percentage of the time for which the signal was high during a time period, we can easily infer that \\(Duty\\ Cycle (\\%) \u003e 50%\\).\nThe culprit here is $R3$. Since both, the charging \u0026amp; discharging currents, flow through $R3$, the charging time can only go as low as the discharging time. Therfore, the duty cycle can only go as low as \\(50\\%\\).\nAnd that friends, is the problem. As discussed before: A servo works with a PWM signal whose duty cycle ranges from \\(5 - 10\\%\\) in \u0026lsquo;ideal situations\u0026rsquo; (which we all know does not exist).\nSo, what about the solution? Well, stay tuned for that ;)\n\\(Spoiler Alert:\\) This problem can be \\(Rectified\\) ;)\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/servo-tester-1/","section":"Blogs","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA couple months back, I decided to dive into some basic electronics and where better to start than the beloved \u003ca\n  href=\"https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm555.pdf\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n  \u003e555 Timer IC\u003c/a\u003e  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.
