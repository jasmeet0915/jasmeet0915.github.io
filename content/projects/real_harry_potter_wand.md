Inspired from the Interactive Wands at Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, this project is a DIY version of those wands made using Computer Vision, Machine Learning, a Raspberry Pi and some other basic electronics. This project allows its user to open/close a box with the correct flicks of a retro-reflector tipped Harry Potter Wand. [Watch the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DyAehKEF4Q&feature=emb_logo) of the project in action.

The project was well recieved on the [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Real-Working-Harry-Potter-Wand-Using-Computer-Visi/) and [Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/jasmeet-singh/real-harry-potter-wand-with-computer-vision-520e3b) community.

The project was also featured on the official blog sites of [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/take-the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-home-with-you/) and [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/04/05/harry-potter-wand-hack-makes-magic-real/).
The project was also featured in the 'Project Showcase' section of the **'MagPi Magazine'(official Raspberry Pi Magazine)** October 2019 edition.
