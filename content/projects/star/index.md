title: "S.T.A.R: Satellite Trajectory Animating & Rendering"
weight: 2
summary: "A fun project with a fusion of art and engineering â€” simulated the trajectories of 300+ Starlink satellites in Blender using orbital mechanics and particle systems. The goal was to make scientifically accurate but cool looking simulations. The project trended on the official Starlink subreddit and drew interest from SpaceX engineers for potential collaboration."
