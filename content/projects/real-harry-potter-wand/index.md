title: "Real Harry Potter Wand using Computer Vision"
weight: 5
summary: "The first project I made in college that got me into Computer Vision and Machine Learning. By tracking the end of a retroreflector-tipped harry potter wand replica and training my own SVM for handwritten character recognition, I was able to do magic in real life. This was demostrated by the spell Alohomora that opens a box when you write 'A' in mid-air using the wand. The project got featured in official blogs at Raspberry Pi, Hackaday and a complete article in the 86th issue of MagPi, the official Raspberry Pi magazine"
