This project is an attempt at creating cool looking yet 'Scientifically Correct Orbital Simulations' for any satellite you want using Blender and Python.
Currently this project simulates around 340 Starlink Satellites launched by SpaceX using a simple 2-body interaction between the Earth & Satellite. 

The future iterations of the project will also take into account various perturbations like the oblateness of Earth, atmospheric drag, gravitational effect of Jupiter etc.

[Watch the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl94gpMpK6M) to see the project in action.

The project was trending for a day at the official [starlink subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/gvcnp8/starlink_satellite_simulation_with_blender_python/).
