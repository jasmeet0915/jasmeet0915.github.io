Sahayak Bot was my first every project using ROS and was creating during the Eyantra Robotics Compeition 2020-21. The aim of the challenge was to develop the software stack for a mobile robot that could autonomously navigate a office environment and deliver things from room to room using Pick & Place and Object Recognition & Localization.

The project was based on ROS melodic and simulated on Gazebo. It uses:
 * Gmapping and AMCL for SLAM
 * ROS navigation stack for autonmous navigation
 * Moveit! for planning and control of the UR5 Arm
 * OpenCV for Object Recognition & Localization

> **Disclaimer:** The video is quite loooooong since I ran it on my previous *potato laptop* :p. Even though the sim time was about *~6min*, in real time it took almost *~30min*.

Our team was selected in the top 7 finalists in the competition out of around 500 teams!
