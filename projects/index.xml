      <description>One of the most unique &amp;amp; challenging problems I have worked on was during the Rally-to-Tally hackathon by Mitsubishi America. It was organized last year with an inventory management-based problem statement of counting a large number of industrial steel pipes with diameters ranging from 2 to 48 inches in an open warehouse spread over acres of land. Being from a robotics background, I knew that a robot would be the best candidate to do such a job with speed, accuracy &amp;amp; ease.</description>

      <description>Functional Weeder (I am talking about the &amp;lsquo;unwanted plants&amp;rsquo; in agricultural fields, just to be clear ðŸ˜’) was a bot made during the Eyantra Robotics Competition of 2021-22. This challenge comprised of creating a fleet of agricultural robots that could autonomously perform tedious tasks like planting seeds &amp;amp; removing weeds. The software for the robot including all algorithms, hardware interface, communication with dashboard, etc. all had to written using Elixir which is a functional programming language.</description>

      <description>Sahayak Bot was my first every project using ROS and was creating during the Eyantra Robotics Compeition 2020-21. The aim of the challenge was to develop the software stack for a mobile robot that could autonomously navigate a office environment and deliver things from room to room using Pick &amp;amp; Place and Object Recognition &amp;amp; Localization.
The project was based on ROS melodic and simulated on Gazebo. It uses:</description>

      <description>This project is an attempt at creating cool looking yet &amp;lsquo;Scientifically Correct Orbital Simulations&amp;rsquo; for any satellite you want using Blender and Python. Currently this project simulates around 340 Starlink Satellites launched by SpaceX using a simple 2-body interaction between the Earth &amp;amp; Satellite.
The future iterations of the project will also take into account various perturbations like the oblateness of Earth, atmospheric drag, gravitational effect of Jupiter etc.</description>

      <description>Inspired from the Interactive Wands at Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, this project is a DIY version of those wands made using Computer Vision, Machine Learning, a Raspberry Pi and some other basic electronics. This project allows its user to open/close a box with the correct flicks of a retro-reflector tipped Harry Potter Wand. Watch the Video of the project in action.
The project was well recieved on the Instructables and Hackster community.</description>
