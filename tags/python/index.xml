The goal was to make scientifically accurate but cool looking simulations. The project trended on the official Starlink subreddit and drew interest from SpaceX engineers for potential collaboration.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://localhost:1313/projects/star/featured.gif"/></item><item><title>S.T.E.W.A.R.D: Smart TErrestrial WArehouse Robot Deployment</title><link>https://localhost:1313/projects/steward/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jasmeet0915@gmail.com (Jasmeet Singh)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/projects/steward/</guid><description>First prize winning project for Mitsubishi America&amp;rsquo;s Rally-To-Tally Online Hackathon. Developed an autonomous solution for their problem statement of inventory management of large industrial steel pipes using computer vision and outdoor mobile robots. Demostrated the PoC with the help of a custom simulation of Husky robot in Gazebo with InfluxDB and Grafana for integration for the data visualization</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://localhost:1313/projects/steward/featured.jpg"/></item><item><title>Real Harry Potter Wand using Computer Vision</title><link>https://localhost:1313/projects/real-harry-potter-wand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jasmeet0915@gmail.com (Jasmeet Singh)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/projects/real-harry-potter-wand/</guid><description>The first project I made in college that got me into Computer Vision and Machine Learning. By tracking the end of a retroreflector-tipped harry potter wand replica and training my own SVM for handwritten character recognition, I was able to do magic in real life. This was demostrated by the spell Alohomora that opens a box when you write &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; in mid-air using the wand. The project got featured in official blogs at Raspberry Pi, Hackaday and a complete article in the 86th issue of MagPi, the official Raspberry Pi magazine</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://localhost:1313/projects/real-harry-potter-wand/featured.jpg"/></item><item><title>Sahayak Bot</title><link>https://localhost:1313/projects/sahayak-bot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jasmeet0915@gmail.com (Jasmeet Singh)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/projects/sahayak-bot/</guid><description>Made during the e-yantra Robotics Competition 2020-21, Sahayak Bot was the first project that introduced me to simulation-based advanced robotics development using ROS &amp;amp; Gazebo. We focused on the developement of the autonomy stack of Sahayak Bot, a mobile manipulator, including navigation, SLAM, perception, manipulation &amp;amp; mission planning using ROS, Gazebo and Moveit!. Upon completition our implementation was selected among top 7 finalists out of almost 500 teams.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://localhost:1313/projects/sahayak-bot/featured.png"/></item></channel></rss>
